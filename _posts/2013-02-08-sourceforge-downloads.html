We have noticed that many people are downloading Jolie 1.0 directly from sourceforge.net. Due to a syncing problem, Sourceforge was only offering an old version of Jolie that is not the same as the one available on this website by following the download instructions. <br/>So if you are one of those people that downloaded Jolie from its sourceforge page, be wary that if you want to run the tutorials found on our website you must download the most recent version available from today (Jolie 1.0). <br/>In general, we always recommend following the download instructions reported in this website instead of downloading Jolie from other sources. <br/>As a more positive note, in the last week or so since we launched this website we have already seen more than 700 downloads! So thank you all for your support and interest from all of the Jolie Development Team!
