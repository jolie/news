Jolie 1.4 has been released. This is a feature release, including support for the new syntax of Internal Services (see the <a href="http://docs.jolie-lang.org/#!documentation/architectural_composition/internal_services.html">docs</a> and the post on <a href="http://fmontesi.blogspot.com/2015/06/non-distributed-microservices.html">non-distributed microservices</a>) and Local Locations. There are also many fixes to the HTTP extension, improvements to the embedding engine for Javascript programs, and improvements to the support tools jolie2java and wsdl2jolie.
