The Jolie team has released the first version of the Visual Studio Code extension for Jolie, called `vscode-jolie`. Get it directly from Visual Studio Code or by visiting [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jolie.vscode-jolie](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jolie.vscode-jolie).

The extension is pretty recent, so expect a lot of fixes and new features in the future. Here are a few cool things that work already:

- Syntax highlighting.
