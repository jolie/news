In honour of the Jolie repository reaching a count of 3000 commits, Jolie 1.6.0 beta1 has been released!<br /><br />This is a beta release, meant for early adopters and testers. Do not use it in production! For this reason, the download link is reported only here and not in our main download page.<br /><br />Download link: <a href="http://www.jolie-lang.org/files/releases/jolie-1.6.0_beta1.jar">http://www.jolie-lang.org/files/releases/jolie-1.6.0_beta1.jar</a><br /><br /><b>Important:</b> This is the first release of Jolie that requires <b>Java 8</b>.
